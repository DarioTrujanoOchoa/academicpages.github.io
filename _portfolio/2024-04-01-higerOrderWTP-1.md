This research explores experimentally whether information acquisition depends
on whose strategy is implemented in a Bayesian learning task. In the first
section of the experiment, I measured the deviation from Bayesâ€™ rule for each
participant and their expected posterior from other participants. In the second
section, I elicit the willingness to pay to get a new signal and implement a rule
based on their posterior beliefs. On average, participants expect others to have
the same posterior beliefs. Finally, it is shown that participants exhibit a larger
willingness to pay for a signal realization when they implement their strategy
rather than the strategy of another participant. These results contribute to the
literature on preferences for decision rights and delegation, as well as strategic
uncertainty.
