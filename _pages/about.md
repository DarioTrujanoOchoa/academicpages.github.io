I am in the last year of my [PhD in Economics at the University of California Santa Barbara](https://econ.ucsb.edu/people/students/dario-trujano-ochoa), where I have developed research in Experimental and Behavioral Economics. 
My research is centered on how individuals process information, form beliefs, and make decisions under uncertainty, with a focus on misinformation and risk preferences. 
I combine experimental methods and theoretical modeling to explore these areas, particularly higher-order beliefs, feedback mechanisms, and how people value information.

I am currently in the Job Market as I near the completion of my Ph.D. in 2025. I’m excited to continue my work in economic research, focusing on information economics and decision theory.
My [Job Market Paper](https://dariotrujanoochoa.github.io/portfolio/2024-10-30-feedbackMisinfo-2/) explores the feedback's effect on the demand for verification in the context of misinformation. The results aim to help design more effective interventions to fight misinformation.

Where am I from?
======

I was born and raised in Mexico City and studied at UNAM, where I got a Bachelor's degree in Psychology and postgraduate training in Statistics. 
There, I became interested in experimental methods and behavior models. With this background, I naturally moved to Economics and decided to complete my Master's in Economics at CIDE, where I was exposed to more rigorous mathematical analysis. 
After graduation, I worked at [IFT](https://www.ift.org.mx/) and [ASBA](https://asbasupervision.org/) and later received the Fulbright-García Robles scholarship to begin my PhD at UCSB in 2019. 


Where am I going next?
======

After graduation, I expect to work in academia, explore the topics that intrigued me during the PhD, and collaborate with other researchers. 
The most important factor is to have a place where I can continue working on the topics I am interested in and increase collaboration networks.
